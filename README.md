Steps involved in the process: 
Apply few image processing techniques to improve the dataset
Separate into training and testing set
Apply dense layer on top of resnet or densenet (Transfer Learning)
Setting accurate training parameters
Build a flask api in order to run the application from web. Refer: https://blog.keras.io/building-a-simple-keras-deep-learning-rest-api.html
